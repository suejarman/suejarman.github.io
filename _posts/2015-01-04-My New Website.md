![My New Website]( {{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/blog/suejarman_blog_1.jpg "My New Website")

My new website is now live, with its own blog!! I’m looking
forward to sharing what I’m working on and some of the
things I love and that inspire me in the world of art and
design.

The backdrop to my first blog image is my favourite 1950s
table. The ceramic letters were found on a pre Christmas
day out to Cambridge, with my designer friends Faye and
Trudy, trudy@buttongirldesigns.co.uk. The colours, well
they’re a bit of a personal signature!!

I’m inspired by anything and everything, but especially
colour, pattern, fashion and architecture. I love to draw,
so expect plenty of that in future blogs; oh, and a bit of
screen printing too!!

Happy New Year, Sue
