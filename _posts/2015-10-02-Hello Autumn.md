Summer’s well and truly over and I luckily caught a few late summer rays a couple of weeks ago, in Devon. With a mix of 
cycling, coastal swims, good coffee and some design inspiration, I feel refreshed.

Salcombe had some diverse creative offerings, from Will Bees Bespoke leather accessories in soft pastel leathers, 
(I’m afraid I had to buy something!!!) to ‘The Drang Gallery’ where I saw a lovely lino cut, ‘Morning’ by Gary Hume, 
which had this shimmering, almost hazy quality to it, and then some screen prints by Sir Peter Blake, who I can’t seem 
to go anywhere at the moment without stumbling across, not that I’m complaining.

Also, I had a bit of a Victoriana day last Thursday, with a visit to 100% Design at Olympia, it’s new location, with 
Earls Court Exhibition Centre now being closed, very sad. Then later, at Alexandra Palace to see Florence and the Machine, 
a brilliant performance, a stunning voice and some great 70’s style fashion.

I’ve just completed some illustrative postcards, capturing some people and their favourite holiday destinations. As well 
as designing a new website for http://www.archbuildingconsultancy.co.uk, the colour palette being a particular hit with the client.

And finally, I Boris Biked to Tent London last Saturday, which was, as always, brilliant!!!
