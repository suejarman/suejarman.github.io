Being visually inspired by a recent trip to Copenhagen, and with it feeling decidedly
Spring-like at the moment I started thinking about colour, trends and fashion, well it is London Fashion Week!

And on this note my highlight of the week has to be Burberry’s exhibition at Makers House, Soho.

AW17 sees Burberry’s chief executive officer Christopher Bailey working with the Henry Moore Foundation – using this iconic British artist’s work as inspiration - his drawings, his sculptures, his colours,
his observations from nature…  to inspire what is brilliant and wonderful design.

The atmosphere inside Makers House was delightful - informally friendly with visitors and staff chatting, sharing and commenting
on the fashion, the designs, and the art. 

It’s obviously nothing new using art to inspire fashion, and this body of work is a perfect fit for the concept of
going back to nature, bringing the outside in, renewal and not to mention the obvious crossover with fashion and sculpture.

The collection features beautifully designed lace that uses the surface textures of Moore’s sculptures to inform the intricate designs;
the use of wool is a direct reference to Moore’s sheep drawings, made from his Hertfordshire studio; and not forgetting the exquisitely
executed capes packed with stitch and textile processes.

My favourite’s, too many to mention, do include a cotton boiler suit with lace shoulder detailing, inspired by the artist’s overalls
and work-wear; and then there's the ‘Reclining Figures Print’ capturing the draughtsmanship quality of Moore’s sketches;
and the beautiful fashion development sketches from the Burberry team’s creative process.

There were also asymmetrical references taken from the sculptural forms, with some beautifully crafted men's brogues championing this. And this
attention to detail even went as far as the ceiling of the exhibition space, with a clear roof being installed just for the show, allowing the sculptures to be viewed, as they were original intended, in as much natural light as possible!

A beautiful continuum - art echoing landscape and human form, and then garments repopulating natural
and urban environments.
 
Celebrating and championing brilliant design and craftsmanship in a fast paced technology driven culture is important – it's refreshing, rejuvenating and really important we don’t lose sight of preserving balance.

We need tactile, need physical objects, and need human interaction working simultaneously and in partnership with digital experiences – there's room for both.

My work embraces both - I wouldn’t have it any other way!

Am feeling rejuvenated and creatively inspired!
