On my way to the Affordable Art Fair, I stopped to enjoy some misty and atmospheric views up the Thames, off of Chelsea Bridge. Almost 
like going back in time, it felt almost Dickensian. One of my show highlights was a brilliant charcoal, ‘Pool Study’ by Patsy McArthur. 
Her bathers suspended in a beautifully transparent weightlessness, with light reflecting and dancing on their skin and the surrounding 
space. There’s just something wonderful about black and white drawings.

A surprise find - I didn’t think that a trip to source some bathroom tiles would take me aboard a fantastic canal barge. The 
rentable accommodation, now on my places to stay list, was moored outside Bert & May’s tile showroom, Bethnal Green. It included a 
log burner and a decadently tiled shower room. I could easily live on board.

Am working on some drawings at present: looking to create some somber and dark imagery of horses, along the lines of my ghosts 
and shadows illustrations. Can’t seem to do cute and fluffy, tend to enjoy dark and scary image making, not sure what says about me!!!

And to complete my water theme, with a good pinch of atmosphere this month, ‘River’, what a great, refreshingly different 
crime drama. I’m just soaking up the cinematography, one of those you need to watch more than once to fully appreciate it on all 
levels. I love moody, gritty and atmospheric imagery. 

Visually and creatively it’s been a very monochromatic month for me.
