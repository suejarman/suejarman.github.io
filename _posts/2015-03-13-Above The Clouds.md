Managed to get above the clouds this month, in the snowy Lake District, just before spring kicked in, my favourite season.
Whilst there I popped into Keswick and I stumbled across ‘Cherrydidi’, a great shop selling a mix of artists’ and designers’ work,
and then a gallery, with some beautiful printmaking by Margaret Morris.

I’ve been producing some infographics, some pen and ink figure illustrations, and dipping my toe into some HTML coding,
well editing at least!!! And I’ve started animating some of my illustrations, love a bit of variety.

And after a long wait, my ‘H is for Hawk’ by Helen Macdonald arrived, and although, only a few pages in, I’m hooked already.
