![New Year Inspiration]( {{ site.baseurl }}/imgs/blog/suejarman_blog_2a.jpg "New Year Inspiration")

I’ve been inspired by my trip to see P J Harvey ‘s ‘Recording in Progress’ installation,
at Somerset House, where she’s recording her latest album inside a one-way glazed glass box.
I enjoyed observing the collaborative creative process,
seeing their attention to detail and clocking the parallels with all good creative collaborations,
whatever the medium.
I could have stayed there all day, and judging by the soft moan of disappointment,
when they announced that it was time to leave, so could have all my fellow observers.
Looking forward to hearing the completed album.

Also managed to submit my entry for the House of Illustration’s book illustration competition,
on ‘The Folio of Ghost Stories’.
It’s been lovely focusing on some sustained drawing and reading some ghost stories in the process.
Just got to see if I can make the long-list, fingers crossed.
I’ve included a small snippet from my sketchbook. 

Can’t believe we’re at the end of January already!!
