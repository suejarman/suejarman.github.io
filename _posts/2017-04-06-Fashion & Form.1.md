The role of a creative is a complex balancing act, a good mix of client projects and briefs’, continuously updating your skills, being inspired by new ideas and other artists and designers work, and of course networking!

Basically, you never really stop thinking art, design, creative… thoughts ideas just arrive at any time.

Travel and journeys are always a good germinator, a way to discover, to look t things afresh.

So during a recent visit to Norway, looking to fill two or three hours with something more stimulating than being sat in in a hot and crowded airport lounge, wishing I were still skiing – so I decided to visit the Heine Onstad Kunstsenter. 

This contemporary art gallery/sculpture park was opened in 1968 and sits on a 140 acre wooded plot, on the coast just outside Oslo – a lovely space.

It was hosting a retrospective of ‘Irma Salo Jaeger’s work’ – she’s described as a ‘master of colour’ and as someone who’s ‘made an indelible mark on modernist painting’ - the work was mainly painting and low relief collage, with a few 3D colour automata – some wonderful pieces.

The work included a series of calm, geometrics in muted and earthy pastels.
A body of vibrant, saturated and more lively pieces - a juxtaposition of geometrics, curves and expressive marks. Then some more recent work, with a more mathematical feel and using limited colour palettes, but still wonderfully vibrant.

The work and the space was in complete contrast to a week of snowy mountains and skiing – probably one of the reasons why it left its mark.
