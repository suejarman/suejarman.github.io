desc: To create a dog character, logo and branding for a new business developing and selling dog related products and services.

      <br>
      The brand name ‘Pampaw’ was provided by the client - the initial brief was to create a character as an icon/symbol and a vehicle for storytelling. The typography was to compliment and sit alongside the character so both could be used together and independently as required.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Key elements in the design process included character development through rough sketches and producing 3D clay models; creating a character with flexibility and humour; considering storytelling and animation options going forward; creating something that conveyed confidence and trust, that was fun and that possessed just the right amount of ‘cuteness’ without being childlike.      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The design journey ended up with a dog character being combined with the’w’ of Pampaw – enabling the icon to be read as a letterform or character as required. The dog character created will be used going forward for animation and storytelling projects as the company evolves.
      <br>
      <br>
      The client’s feedback was “I love it!” and “Everyone loves Pampaw”
