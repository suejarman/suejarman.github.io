desc: ‘Ghosts and Shadows’ was a collaborative installation project, commissioned by The Beetroot Tree Gallery in Derbyshire.

      Wordsmith Dave Wood and myself were commissioned to respond to the history of the gallery space with words and illustrations respectively.
      The outcome was a series of sequential images in suspended old window frames. The windows, their illustrations, and typographical snippets were accompanied by readings and atmospheric audio.
      This multifaceted project was challenging and effective – responding with images to a story or text is one of my favourite methods of generating imagery.

      The installation was displayed in the gallery as a stand alone exhibition.

      Some of the images went on to be selected for the Association of Illustrators ‘Images 30’ book and exhibition.
