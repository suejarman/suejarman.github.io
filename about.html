        <p class="font-xsmall"> I’m a designer and image-maker producing illustration, graphic design and creative ideas for print and digital platforms.</p>
        <p class="font-xsmall"> As a visual problem solver I listen, analyse and communicate - enabling me to deliver diverse work and fresh ideas for a broad range of clients and brands.</p>
        <p class="font-xsmall"> My work is concerned with aesthetics and content, developing conceptual ideas with a narrative, and communicating messages.</p>
        <p class="font-xsmall"> Being freelance gives me the flexibility to respond fast and intuitively to projects and briefs’ – it also gives me the ability to offer a broad range of technical skills and services.</p>
        <p class="font-xsmall"> I specialise in blending traditional and digital techniques and processes seamlessly and have an innate sense of colour, placement and layout skills.</p>
        <p class="font-xsmall"> I produce hand drawn, vector and 3D illustrations and infographics; design logos, brands and websites; produce layout and promotional material; develop still, moving and animated illustrations and graphics. I also help with the visual and content aspects of developing a social media presence for clients, from providing and developing tailored visual imagery and content through to more technical aspects of editing and formatting content.<br>
        <p class="font-xsmall"> I'm also continuously working on personal and collaborative projects.</p>
