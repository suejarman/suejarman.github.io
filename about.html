          I’m a designer and image-maker producing illustration, graphic design and creative ideas for print and digital platforms.
          As a visual problem solver I listen, analyse and communicate - enabling me to deliver diverse work and fresh ideas for a broad range of clients and brands.
          My work is concerned with aesthetics and content, developing conceptual ideas with a narrative, and communicating messages.
          Being freelance gives me the flexibility to respond fast and intuitively to projects and briefs’ – it also gives me the ability to offer a broad range of technical skills and services.
          I specialise in blending traditional and digital techniques and processes seamlessly and have an innate sense of colour, placement and layout skills.
          I produce hand drawn, vector and 3D illustrations and infographics; design logos, brands and websites; produce layout and promotional material; develop still, moving and animated illustrations and graphics. I also help with the visual and content aspects of developing a social media presence for clients, from providing and developing tailored visual imagery and content through to more technical aspects of editing and formatting content.
          I'm also continuously working on personal and collaborative projects.
