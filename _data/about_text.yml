paragraphs:
  - paragraph: I’m an illustrator, designer and art director. My work is a mix of image making, concept development, picture editing and story telling.

  - paragraph: I produce illustration, surface design and photography to commission. I develop innovative concepts, create visual identities and produce brand communication ideas, and products for a broad range of clients and business.

  - paragraph: I work independently, collaboratively, and sometimes as part of a larger team. Being an independent creative gives me the freedom and flexibility to provide a personal, hands-on approach to the projects I’m involved with. I can therefore be commissioned for complete, or specific parts of projects, as required.

  - paragraph: My work uses digital and traditional techniques, with moving image and/or printed media outcomes.

  - paragraph: I use drawing and photography to analyse, record and develop ideas; considered colour, layering and narrative are consistent elements within my work. 

  - paragraph: I can help with visual identities, graphic design layouts, promotional material, redesigning logos, refreshing elements on a website and producing spot illustrations. I can also provide design ideas and creative inspiration.

  - paragraph: Please contact me if you’d like to discuss a project idea, at whatever stage of the process you might be.
