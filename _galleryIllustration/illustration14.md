    SUPPORT4CO is a charity that supports families with children who have been diagnosed with cancer. Support comes from 
    families who have already been through the trauma of a child with cancer, with advice, guidance, moral support, small 
    bursaries and just somebody to talk to who have gone through the same experience.
